      <p>I'm Alex. I'm a London-based (product) designer. I'm passionate about creating intuitive, accessible experiences that solve problems and deliver value through research, insight and visual design.</p>
      <p>I currently work as part of Sainsbury's Experience Design team on their Groceries Online product. Previously I spent time at an insurtech start-up and at Songkick.com designing and developing campaigns for some of the world's biggest artists.</p>
      <p>I like noisy music and baking my own bread.</p>
